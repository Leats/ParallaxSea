# ParallaxSea

This was made a while ago to test out Phaser 3. It is a small script, which shows an underwater landscape with parallax effect. There are fish and air bubbles to give the scene more life. 

Sound was added, as well. ( Source: https://freesound.org/people/cubicApocalypse/sounds/195509/ )
